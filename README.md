# Vision
* Repository tracks the development and documentation of the vision/idea.
* The vision/idea be broken and organised in Stage 0->1 and Stage 1->10, at least.
* (Optionally) Rough drafts can be created as <filename>.rough.md. This rough file can be considered as a WIP. Once the first iteration of a vision doc/pager is reviewed and considered complete, the rough file can be removed and the file without "rough" can be retained for future references and modifications.
